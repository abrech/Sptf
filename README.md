# Sptf
Sptf is a small personal project made to automatically update Spotify playlists and collect data about songs and artists I am listening to.  
To use this, an "account.env" file has to be created in the config folder, containing the following:  
- USERNAME="username"
- CLIENT_ID="clientid"
- CLIENT_SECRET="clientsecret"
- DEVICE_NAME="nameofdevice"
- ALT_DEVICE_NAME="DESKTOP-XXX"
- ALT_DEVICE_NAME_2="XXXX"  
To obtain a client ID and client secret, an app has to be created in the Spotify developer section.
